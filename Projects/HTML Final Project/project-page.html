        <h2>Login & Register Form Project</h2>
        <p>
          This project is called "Login & Register Form" because it contains
          forms for logging in and registering on this website. This website
          only includes HTML5, and the buttons are all functional, except that
          it lacks the functionality to store the email and password for access,
          requiring another programming language to complete it.

        <h2>Video Project</h2>
        <p>
          This project is named "Video Project," alternatively "Favorite
          Celebrity," because it contains videos and resembles a part of
          YouTube. This project includes the song "Si Mua" by Dafina Zeqiri &
          Elgit Doda, and the choice was made according to preference. This
          website is created to serve as a kind of biography of what the video
          contains and the artists involved.
