            <h2>Earliest Inhabitants</h2>

            <p>
              The earliest known inhabitants of the area lived around 9200 BC,
              based on evidence found throughout the area and especially at the
              much-studied Gault Archeological Site, north of the city.

            <h2>Native Peoples</h2>

            <p>
              When Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by the Tonkawa
              tribe. Comanches and Lipan Apaches also traveled in the region.
              Though they came into contact with Spanish explorers and missions,
              few settlements were established for several centuries.

            <h2>Geographic Distinction</h2>

            <p>
              Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones Escarpment, a long
              stable and inactive fault line, on the Colorado River. This fault
              divides the Hill Country to the West of Austin from the prairie
              land to the East.
