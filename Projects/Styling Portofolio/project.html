        This project is called "Login & Register Form" because it contains
        forms for logging in and registering on this website. This website
        only includes HTML5, and the buttons are all functional, except that
        it lacks the functionality to store the email and password for access,
        requiring another programming language to complete it.

      <p>
        This project is named "Video Project," alternatively "Favorite
        Celebrity," because it contains videos and resembles a part of
        YouTube. This project includes the song "Si Mua" by Dafina Zeqiri &
        Elgit Doda, and the choice was made according to preference. This
        website is created to serve as a kind of biography of what the video
        contains and the artists involved.
